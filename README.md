### Gym Badge Crafting

Starting from 1.9.0, Locked Gym Badges and Gym Badge Unlocker is removed. Instead, crafting Gym Badges are disabled for those without permissions represented either by LuckPerms permission node or op level 2.

### Create Mod

The new permission system does not prevent crafting via Create blocks (such as Mechanical Crafters or Mixers). To require badges to be crafted by hand, name the recipe JSON file [recipe]_manual_only.json.

## Features
