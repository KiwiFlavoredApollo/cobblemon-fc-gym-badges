### Gym Badge Crafting

Starting from 1.9.0, Locked Gym Badges and Gym Badge Unlocker is removed. Instead, crafting Gym Badges are disabled for those without permissions represented either by LuckPerms permission node or op level 2.

### Create Mod

The new permission system doesn't block when crafted with Create blocks (such as Mechanical Crafters or Mixers). In order to mandate crafting badges by hand, name the recipe JSON file like `[recipe]_manual_only.json`.

## Features

- Support for LuckPerms

## Permission Nodes

```
fcgymbadges.darkbadge
fcgymbadges.flyingbadge
fcgymbadges.iciclebadge
...
```
